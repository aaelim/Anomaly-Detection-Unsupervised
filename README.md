# Anomaly-Detection-Unsupervised

Healthcare Anomaly Detection.ipynb is the Jupyter Notebook and the best file to visualize the project. Unsupervised Anomlay Detection.pdf is in pdf format for those that prefer this over a Jupyter notebook (download for higher quality visualization). To run, all files need to be included in the relevant folders, all libraries need to be installed, and the Kaggle dataset (not included) from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tamilsel/healthcare-providers-data needs to be downloaded. Generated files are not included but can be acquired by running all the code.
